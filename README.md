# NASA MISSE Data Analysis App

This project is an interactive **Streamlit web application** designed to analyze data from NASAâ€™s **Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE)**. The app enables users to upload Excel datasets, map columns across different sheets, and visualize critical material degradation parameters such as **erosion yield, mass loss, thickness, solar exposure, and AO fluence**.  

It also integrates **regression and classification models** for predictions, along with **survival score analysis and visualization**.

## Features

- **Excel Upload & Sheet Selection**: Import multi-sheet Excel files for analysis.  
- **Dynamic Column Mapping**: Select and map dataset columns interactively.  
- **Data Visualization**: Generate plots for erosion yield, mass loss, thickness, solar exposure, and AO fluence.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Includes regression and classification models for analysis.  
- **Survival Score Analysis**: Compute and visualize material survival metrics.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an intuitive and accessible experience.

âœ… This version will render perfectly on GitHub â€” with proper **headers, bullet points, and code blocks**.  

Do you want me to also add **badges** (like Python version, Streamlit, license) at the top to make it look even more professional?
